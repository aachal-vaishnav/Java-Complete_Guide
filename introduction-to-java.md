# 1. Introduction to Java

## 1.1 Why You Must Learn Java
- Java is one of the most popular programming languages.
- Runs on over 6 billion devices.
- Used in web apps, mobile apps (Android), enterprise software, and backend development.
- Offers high-paying jobs and has great community support.
- Follows Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## 1.2 What is a Programming Language?
- A way to give instructions to a computer.
- Humans use high-level languages like Java.
- Computers understand only 0s and 1s (binary).
- A *compiler* converts high-level language to low-level (machine) code.

## 1.3 What is an Algorithm?
- A step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or perform a task.
- Example: Steps to make tea or sort numbers.

## 1.4 What is Syntax?
- The set of rules to write valid code in a language.
- Like grammar in English, programming languages need proper syntax to be understood by the compiler.

## 1.5 History of Java
- Developed by *James Gosling* at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s.
- Originally called *Oak, renamed **Java* in 1995.
- Introduced *“Write Once, Run Anywhere”* using bytecode and JVM.
- Expanded from applets to server-side applications over the years.

## 1.6 Magic of Byte Code
- Java code is compiled into *Bytecode* (.class file).
- Bytecode runs on the *Java Virtual Machine (JVM)*.
- JVM allows the same code to run on different platforms (cross-platform compatibility).

## 1.7 How Java Changed the Internet
- Java enabled portable and secure applications through its JVM model.
- Ideal for building distributed systems and web apps.

## 1.8 Java Buzzwords
| Keyword        | Meaning                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Robust         | Strong memory management, error handling, avoids crashes               |
| Multithreaded  | Can run multiple tasks simultaneously                                   |
| Architecture Neutral | Bytecode runs on any platform with JVM                           |
| Interpreted and High Performance | Uses JIT compiler for optimized execution            |
| Distributed    | Built-in support for networking and distributed computing              |


## 1.9 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Java follows OOP principles like:
  - *Encapsulation*: Hiding data inside classes.
  - *Inheritance*: Code reuse from parent classes.
  - *Polymorphism*: One interface, many implementations.
  - *Abstraction*: Hiding implementation, showing only the interface.
